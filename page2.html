        Then one day the dove came and said, "Will you do something for my
        sake?" "With all my heart," said the girl.  Then said the little
        dove, "I will guide you to a small house, enter it and inside it, an
        old woman will be sitting by the fire and will say, 'good-day.' But
        on your life give her no answer, let her do what she will, but pass
        by her on the right side. Further on, there is a door, which open,
        and you will enter into a room where a quantity of rings of all kinds
        are lying, amongst which are some magnificent ones with shining
        stones.  Leave them, however, where they are, and seek out a plain
        one, which must likewise be amongst them, and bring it here to me as
        quickly as you can."
        <br />
        <br />
        The girl went to the little house, and came to the door.  There sat
        an old woman who stared when she saw her, and said, "Good-day my
        child." The girl gave her no answer, and opened the door.  "Whither
        away?" cried the old woman, and seized her by the gown, and wanted to
        hold her fast, saying, "That is my house, no one can go in there if I
        choose not to allow it." But the girl was silent, got away from her,
        and went straight into the room.
