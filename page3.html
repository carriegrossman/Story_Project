        Now there lay on the table an enormous quantity of rings, which
        gleamed and glittered before her eyes.  She turned them over and
        looked for the plain one, but could not find it.  While she was
        seeking, she saw the old woman and how she was stealing away, and
        wanting to go off with a bird-cage which she had in her hand.  So she
        went after her and took the cage out of her hand, and when she raised
        it up and looked into it, a bird was inside which had the plain ring
        in its bill.
        <br />
        <br />
        Then she took the ring, and ran quite joyously home with it, and
        thought the little white dove would come and get the ring, but it did
        not.  Then she leant against a tree, determined to wait for the dove.
        As she thus stood, it seemed just as if the tree was soft and pliant,
        and was letting its branches down.  And suddenly the branches twined
        around her, and were two arms, and when she looked around, the tree
        was a handsome man, who embraced and kissed her heartily, and said,
        "You have delivered me from the power of the old woman, who is a
        wicked witch.  She had changed me into a tree, and every day for two
        hours I was a white dove, and so long as she possessed the ring I
        could not regain my human form." Then his servants and his horses,
        who had likewise been changed into trees, were freed from the
        enchanter also, and stood beside him.  And he led them forth to his
        kingdom, for he was a king's son, and they married, and lived
        happily.
