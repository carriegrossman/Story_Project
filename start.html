      <p class="paragraph">
        A poor servant-girl was once traveling with the family with which she
        was in service, through a great forest, and when they were in the
        midst of it, robbers came out of the thicket, and murdered all they
        found.  All perished together except the girl, who had jumped out of
        the carriage in a fright, and hidden herself behind a tree.  When the
        robbers had gone away with their booty, she came out and beheld the
        great disaster.  Then she began to weep bitterly, and said, "What can
        a poor girl like me do now?  I do not know how to get out of the
        forest, no human being lives in it, so I must certainly starve."
