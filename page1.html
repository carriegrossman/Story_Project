        She walked about and looked for a road, but could find none.  When it
        was evening she seated herself under a tree, gave herself into God's
        keeping, and resolved to sit waiting there and not go away, let
        happen what might.  When she had sat there for a while, a white dove
        came flying to her with a little golden key in its beak.  It put the
        little key in her hand, and said, "Do you see that great tree,
        therein is a little lock, open it with the tiny key, and you will
        find food enough, and suffer no more hunger."
        <br />
        <br />
        Then she went to the tree and opened it, and found milk in a little
        dish, and white bread to break into it, so that she could eat her
        fill.  When she was satisfied, she said, "It is now the time when the
        hens at home go to roost, I am so tired I could go to bed too." Then
        the dove flew to her again, and brought another golden key in its
        bill, and said, "Open that tree there, and you will find a bed." So
        she opened it, and found a beautiful white bed, and she prayed God to
        protect her during the night, and lay down and slept.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the morning the dove came for the third time, and again brought a
        little key, and said, "Open that tree there, and you will find
        clothes." And when she opened it, she found garments beset with gold
        and with jewels, more splendid than those of any king's daughter.  So
        she lived there for some time, and the dove came every day and
        provided her with all she needed, and it was a quiet good life.
